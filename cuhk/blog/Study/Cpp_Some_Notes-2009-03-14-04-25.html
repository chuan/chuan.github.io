        <h1>C++: Some Notes</h1>

        <p>I don't use C++ that often. Here are some notes kept as a remainder for my own.</p>
<ul>
<li>In many C++ books, like "C++ Programming Language", pointer are of the format "type* foo" instead of "type *foo" as in C.</li>
<li>Initializing variables inside a class definition are only allowed for enumeration types or integral types, e.g. int, char, long, etc. For example, the following declaration is not allowed.<br />
<pre class="code">
 class Foo
 {
   public:
     static char bar[10] = "abcdefghi";
 };
</pre></li>
<li>When to use auto_ptr?
<blockquote>
<p>Many resources are dynamically allocated on the heap, are used only within a single block or function, and should be released when control leaves that block or function.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Because an auto_ptr automatically deletes what it points to when the auto_ptr is destroyed, it's important that there never be more than one auto_ptr pointing to an object.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>The only difference between struct and class is the default access level: public for formmer and private for latter.</li>
<li>No object can be created for abstract classes.</li>
<li>The declaration of struct, union, class, or enum adds the type to the type names.</li>
<li>With direct initialization, an integer can be initialized as "int a(10);".</li>
<li>In an assignment-like initializer, if the object is of class type, the value to the right of the equal sign is converted to a temporary object of desired type, and the first object is costructed by calling its copy constructor.</li>
</ul>
