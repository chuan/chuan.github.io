        <h1>﻿Argument</h1>

        
<p>
Just read the "GRE General Practice Book" sent to me by ETS.
The Argument Task is totally different from my prospective.
The sample topic states:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Hospital statistics regarding people who go to the emergency
room after roller skating accidents indicate the need for more
protective equipment. Within this group of people, 75 percent
of those who had accidents in streets or parking lots were not
wearing any protective clothing (helmets, knee pads, etc.) or
any light-reflecting material (clip-on lights, glow-in-the-dark
wrist pads, etc.). Clearly, these statistics indicate that by
investing in high-quality skaters will greatly reduce their risk
of being severaly injured in an accident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In my opinion, the most significant flaw in this argument is
that it does not take into account of the ratio of people who wearing
equipment to those who do not.
Say, for example, 95 percent people do not wear protective equipment
while only 5 precentage do.
According the the statistics, the risk among those who wear equipemnt
will be higher than those who do not.</p>
<p>
However, none of the analyses care about this point.
Without this vital point, I think all other very detailed
analysis as given by ETS worth nothing.</p>
