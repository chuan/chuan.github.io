        <h1>SEG5580 Lecture Notes</h1>

        <p>The course offered in the department with code SEG5580 and title "Advanced Stochastic Models" is very interesting and substantial. It is very well taught by the professor. I gave it full score during course evaluation. All lecture notes are written by the professor on the white board. I put my notes taken in the class into Latex. You can see the whole set of notes in the attachment.</p>
