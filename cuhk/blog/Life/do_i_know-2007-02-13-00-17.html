        <h1>﻿Do I know where I'am going to?</h1>

        <p>
The song just came into my ear suddenly and stunned me for a few seconds,
for the question is just what I wan to ask myself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Theme From Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To?)<br />
<br />
(M. Masser/G. Goffin)<br />
<br /></p>
<p>
Do you know where you're going to?<br />
Do you like the things that life is showing you<br />
Where are you going to?<br />
Do you know...?</p>
<p>
Do you get<br />
What you're hoping for<br />
When you look behind you<br />
There's no open door<br />
What are you hoping for?<br />
Do you know...?</p>
<p>
Once we were standing still in time<br />
Chasing the fantasies<br />
That filled our minds<br />
You knew how I loved you<br />
But my spirit was free<br />
Laughin' at the questions<br />
That you once asked of me</p>
<p>
Do you know where you're going to?<br />
Do you like the things that life is showing you<br />
Where are you going to?<br />
Do you know...?</p>
<p>
Now looking back at all we've planned<br />
We let so many dreams<br />
Just slip through our hands<br />
Why must we wait so long<br />
Before we'll see<br />
How sad the answers<br />
To those questions can be</p>
<p>
Do you know where you're going to?<br />
Do you like the things that life is showing you<br />
Where are you going to?<br />
Do you know...?</p>
<p>
Do you get<br />
What you're hoping for<br />
When you look behind you<br />
There's no open door<br />
What are you hoping for?<br />
Do you know...?</p>
