        <h1>The Circle Game</h1>

        <p>An old folk song by Joni Mitchell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Yesterday a child came out to wonder<br />
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar<br />
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder<br />
And tearful at the falling of a star<br />
And the seasons they go round and round<br />
And the painted ponies go up and down<br />
We're captive on the carousel of time<br />
We can't return we can only look behind<br />
From where we came<br />
And go round and round and round<br />
In the circle game<br />
</p>
<p>
Then the child moved ten times round the seasons<br />
Skated over ten clear frozen streams<br />
Words like, when you're older, must appease him<br />
And promises of someday make his dreams<br />
And the seasons they go round and round<br />
And the painted ponies go up and down<br />
We're captive on the carousel of time<br />
We can't return we can only look behind<br />
From where we came<br />
And go round and round and round<br />
In the circle game<br />
</p>
<p>
Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now<br />
Cartwheels turn to car wheels thru the town<br />
And they tell him,<br />
Take your time, it won't be long now<br />
Till you drag your feet just to slow the circles down<br />
And the seasons they go round and round<br />
And the painted ponies go up and down<br />
We're captive on the carousel of time<br />
We can't return we can only look behind<br />
From where we came<br />
And go round and round and round<br />
In the circle game<br />
</p>
<p>
So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty<br />
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true<br />
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty<br />
Before the last revolving year is through<br />
And the seasons they go round and round<br />
And the painted ponies go up and down<br />
We're captive on the carousel of time<br />
We can't return, we can only look behind<br />
From where we came<br />
And go round and round and round<br />
In the circle game<br />
</p>
