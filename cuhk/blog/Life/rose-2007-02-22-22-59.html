        <h1>﻿Rose</h1>

        <p>
I do not like the song for I think it is too slow.
Neither do I like the Westlife's re-interpretation.
However the <a href="http://www.amcbroom.com/rose.html">lyric</a>
really suits my current mood.
I am afraid of dying very much.
Every morning, I stay in bed very late in hope to have good dreams.
I want to get rid of my current statue.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Some say love, it is a river<br />
That drowns the tender reed<br />
Some say love, it is a razor<br />
That leaves your soul to bleed<br />
Some say love, it is a hunger<br />
An endless aching need<br />
I say love, it is a flower<br />
And you, its only seed<br />
</p>
<p>
It's the heart, afraid of breaking<br />
That never learns to dance<br />
It's the dream, afraid of waking<br />
That never takes the chance<br />
It's the one who won't be taken<br />
Who cannot seem to give<br />
And the soul, afraid of dying<br />
That never learns to live<br />
</p>
<p>
When the night has been too lonely<br />
And the road has been too long<br />
And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong<br />
Just remember in the winter<br />
Far beneath the bitter snow<br />
Lies the seed<br />
That with the sun's love, in the spring<br />
Becomes the rose<br />
</p>
