        <h1>﻿The Prologue to Bertrand Russell's Autobiography</h1>

        
<blockquote>
<p><b>What I Have Lived For</b></p>
<p>
Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.</p>
<p>
I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy - ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness--that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what--at last--I have found.</p>
<p>
With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, I have achieved.</p>
<p>
Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate this evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer.</p>
<p>
This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>这段文字我原来曾经读过。
但是就像很多其它的文字，我并没有读懂。
当初也许只是一笑而过，现在重读之后却非常的震撼。
看过这段话，我的感觉就是作者在非常真诚的回答他自己提出的问题。
我曾经以为活着“只不过是因为贪恋肉体和精神的各种快感，和畏惧临死前的痛苦”。
现在觉得如果在未来的某一天，在结束生命旅程前，能有这样的领悟，也许就达到了生的意义吧。</p>
